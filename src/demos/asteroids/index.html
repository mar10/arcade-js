<p>
	<b>Overview</b><br>
	jsAsteroids is a clone of a famous arcade game written in 1979.<br>
	It was created as a demo for the open source game engine
	<a href="https://github.com/mar10/arcade-js/">arcade.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
	This game requires HTML5 support, namely &lt;canvas> and &lt;audio>.
	Therefore it will <b>not</b> run on Internet Explorer &lt;= 8.<br>
	It was tested however with Firefox 3.6, Chrome 8, Safari 5, iPod 3, and
	iPhone 4 and seems to run. Only	sound is a bit flakey.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Usage</b><br>

	<i>Conrols</i><br>
	Use <kbd>[Up]</kbd>, <kbd>[Left]</kbd>, and <kbd>[Right]</kbd> keys to move
	the player's rocket. Press <kbd>[Space]</kbd> to fire.<br>
	Note that there are no breaks: you have to turn by 180° and accelerate
	instead.
</p>
<p>
	The game is over, when the all three rockets are lost.
