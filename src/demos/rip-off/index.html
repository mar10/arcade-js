<div class="info">
<p>
	<b>Overview</b><br>
	jsRipOff is a clone of the <i>Rip-off</i> game written by Tim Skelly for
	Cinematronics in 1980.<br>
	It was created as a demo for the open source game
	engine <a href="http://arcade-js.googlecode.com/">arcade.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
	This game requires HTML5 support, namely &lt;canvas> and &lt;audio>.
	Therefore it will <b>not</b> run on Internet Explorer &lt;= 8.<br>
	It was tested however with Firefox 3.6, Chrome 8, Safari, and seems to run. Only
	sound is a bit flakey.
	<br>
	The <i>flocking</i> behavior of the bandits is roughly mimicked, but not yet
	complete.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Usage</b><br>
	The goal of this game is to protect eight canisters in the center of the
	screen from being ripped-off by waves of enemies.<br>
	Enemies can be destroyed by firing at or colliding with them.<br>
	The players have infinite lives, but there is a small time penalty every
	time the player is hit.<br>
	<i>Player 1</i><br>
	Use <kbd>[Up]</kbd>, <kbd>[Left]</kbd>, and <kbd>[Right]</kbd> keys to move
	the player's tank. Press <kbd>[Space]</kbd> to fire.<br>
	<i>Player 2 (or alternatively in single player mode)</i><br>
	Use Mouse and left-click to move to cursor. Use right-click to aim and fire.
</p>
<p>
	The game is over, when the last canister was dragged off the screen by the
	enemies.
